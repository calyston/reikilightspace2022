        The belief that life energy flows through the body, deeply affecting our entire being, 
        has been embraced by many ancient cultures. The word ‘Reiki’ means universal life energy. 
        It is a gentle, holistic method of healing and relaxation which can help to bring balance 
        and harmony on a physical, emotional and spiritual level.</p>
