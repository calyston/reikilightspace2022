# Reikilight Space

Reikilight Space is a responsive WordPress website for reiki and hypnotherapy services. After conducting 
research on competitors and businesses in similar services, I created the design using Adobe XD, and built the 
website using PHP, WordPress, SASS, and JavaScript. The website has a JavaScript mobile menu and back to top button, and multiple pages detailing the services.
